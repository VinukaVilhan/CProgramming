# Data Structures and Algorithms Questions

## Question 1

(a) Compare and contrast Stack and Queue data structures under two (2) criteria.

1. Order of elements processing?

- Stack follows a LIFO principle, meaning the most recently added element is the first to be removed
- Queue follows a FIFO principle, meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed

1. Operations and Usage

- Stack supports opertaions like push(add an element) and pop(remove an element). It's commonly used in recursive fucntion calls, undo-redo features, and expression evalvation.

- Queue supports enqueue and dequeue. It's useful in request handling, scheduling systems, and real-time data processing.

(b) Explain how a Queue can be implemented using an array?

- An array could be initialized with variables for front and rear to keep track of the begininng and the end of the array.
- When enqued it will increase the rear position of the array
- When dequeuing it will remove the first element of the array and increment the head of the array
- It will always check if the front is larager than the rear to check if it is empty

## Question 2

(a) What is the base condition in the recusrion function?

- This is the condition which stops furthur recursive calls. It serves as a termination criteria.
