calloc and malloc functions are used for memory allocation. 

calloc allocated memory is initialized to 0.
malloc allocated memory is not initialized.

calloc uses two paramenter in its function; number of elemnts and the size of each element
malloc uses one paramenter to allocate memory. The total bytes to allocate memory (number of elements * sizeof data type)

malloc works faster because it does not need to set memory as zero
calloc works slower due to initialization of memory to 0
